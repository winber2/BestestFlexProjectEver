Bellman-Ford

Description

How it works
Finds distance from source node to all other nodes //needs change
1. Assign a source node and set its distance value (cost / weight?) to 0. All other nodesâ€™ distance value to infinity. //Anything else?
2. From the source node it relaxes all the edges in the graph that are outgoing from the source node.
3. Iterate over every node V-1 times (V = # of vertices) and updates the cost of getting from source node to every node if the cost is less than the previous cost of getting to the node //wordy and shitty
4. The algorithm ends when it iterates over the nodes V-1 times or if the current and previous iteration is the same.
5. //need to add something about negative cycles?
6. //Anything else to include??

Pros
- Accounts for negative weights
- Determines if negative-weight cycles exist
- Allows for a wider class of inputs than Dijkstra


Cons
-

Time Complexity
Best
O(E) or O(n)
Worst
O((V-1) * E) or O(n^2)

Pseudo code

```
function BellmanFord(list vertices, list edges, vertex source)
   ::distance[],predecessor[]

   // This implementation takes in a graph, represented as
   // lists of vertices and edges, and fills two arrays
   // (distance and predecessor) with shortest-path
   // (less cost/distance/metric) information

   // Step 1: initialize graph
   for each vertex v in vertices:
       distance[v] := inf             // At the beginning , all vertices have a weight of infinity
       predecessor[v] := null         // And a null predecessor

   distance[source] := 0              // Except for the Source, where the Weight is zero

   // Step 2: relax edges repeatedly
   for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
       for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
           if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
               distance[v] := distance[u] + w
               predecessor[v] := u

   // Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles
   for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
       if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
           error "Graph contains a negative-weight cycle"
   return distance[], predecessor[]
